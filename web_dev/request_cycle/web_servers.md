2. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

First of, it is Open Source in that is it freely available for anyone to download, modify, and redistribute. Essentially this means that it is primarily developed as a group effort by volunteers on the Internet from all over the world. There is no single organization or group responsible for doing so. The amazing part is that it doesn't require much background in Unix. However, if you choose to dive deeper it can get more complicated. 

3. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

It is the ability to have a machine that is SaaS. Imagine if you needed to install/run/test any software anywhere in the world at a fraction of the cost. You are able to do so. Usually this is provided by some Internet hosting service like Digital Ocean etc. It's AWESOME. Advantages include price, speed, security and much much more.

4. Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

It comes down to security and vulnerability. From you doing something stupid to getting hacked etc. Frankly you don't need to be on it so why take the risk.
