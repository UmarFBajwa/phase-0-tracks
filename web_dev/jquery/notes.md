First understand the Usecase/s for jQuery. Why was it created? What is it used for? What are its limitations? How does it work? Look at some examples?

Then explore/deconstruct the rules aka syntax. Are there certain structures? How similar is it to languages like Javascript? How is it different? What will it help with and how will it interfere? Where might it be easier and where might it be more difficult?

Gather all relevant material. Look at Tutorials, Examples, and maybe Youtube videos, but only after I have actively practiced each concept.

Bookmark like crazy.

Find a cheatsheet.

Review the documentation. Understand it.

Take Javascript I have written, like Event Listeners and write lines of code using jQuery that make it shorter. Test it...

General Rules of Thumb:
-Use different resources to capture the complexities and millions of syntax rules it could potentially have. Also learning to program can ber surprisingly arbitrary.
-Take breaks in between to test what I have learned. If I cannot explaing it simply, then I do not understand it well enough.
-Deliberate practice makes perfect. Practice doesn't make perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect. How I practice matters far more than how much time I spend practicing.
